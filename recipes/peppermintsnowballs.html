        <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups confectioners' sugar</li>

<li>1 ¼ cups butter, softened</li>

<li>1 teaspoon peppermint extract</li>

<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

<li>1 egg</li>

<li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>

<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>

<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

<li>1 cup white sugar, or as needed</li>

<li>1 cup finely crushed peppermint candy</li>

<li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h4>Directions</h4></p>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets, or line with parchment paper.</li>

            <li>Beat 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar with the butter, peppermint extract, vanilla extract, and egg in a mixing bowl at Medium speed until well blended and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce speed to Low, and gradually mix in the flour, baking powder, and salt until well blended, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup crushed peppermint candy using a wooden spoon.</li>
            
            <li>Place the white sugar in a shallow bowl. Roll a small amount of cookie dough between your hands to make 3/4 inch diameter balls. Roll in sugar. Place 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets.</li>
            
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until light brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove and cool on racks.</li>
            
            <li>Meanwhile, to make the glaze, stir the remaining 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar together with the milk in a bowl until smooth. Drizzle cooled cookies with the glaze, and sprinkle immediately with the remaining crushed peppermint candy.</li>
        </ol>
